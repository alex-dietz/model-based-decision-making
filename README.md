# Flood Mitigation Project for the Ijssel River

This repository contains the code and resources for a Flood Mitigation Project focused on the Ijssel River. The project aims to explore and implement strategies to mitigate the risk of flooding in the surrounding areas.

## Project Overview

The Ijssel River is a major river in the Netherlands that poses a significant flood risk due to its geographical location and the potential for heavy rainfall. This project seeks to develop effective flood mitigation strategies by utilizing data analysis and modeling techniques.

The repository includes two main Jupyter Notebooks:

open_exploration.ipynb: This notebook provides an open exploration of the model, its levers, and uncertainties.

directed_search.ipynb: This notebook focuses on implementing a directed search for potential flood mitigation strategies. It uses robust decision making and optimization techniques to identify effective strategies.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

data/: This directory contains the relevant datasets used in the project, including historical flood data, river flow measurements, and any other pertinent information.

notebooks/: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebooks that form the core of the project. The open_exploration.ipynb notebook explores the data and identifies key patterns, while the directed_search.ipynb notebook focuses on developing flood mitigation strategies.

models/: If applicable, this directory contains any pre-trained models or model configurations used in the project.

reports/: This directory holds any reports or documentation related to the project. It may include findings, insights, and recommendations resulting from the analysis and modeling.

utils/: This directory contains utility scripts or functions that support the notebooks or any other code used in the project.
